I'm Kyle (he/him), a 10 year veteran of software and data engineering. I'm well versed in [Python](https://github.com/kyleries/aoc_2022), [SQL](https://github.com/kyleries/aoc_2021/tree/main/models), and [Ruby](https://github.com/dbt-labs/homebrew-dbt/pull/161) (if you recently had trouble installing dbt on a Mac, I [fixed](https://github.com/dbt-labs/homebrew-dbt/pull/161) it for you! :smile: ) 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a [Singer.io](https://www.singer.io/) tap for the [Energy Administration Information](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/) public data to quickly and easily move data from their API to your target of choice.

## Data Engineering

I recently [fixed](https://github.com/dbt-labs/homebrew-dbt/pull/161) dbt installations on Mac.

I built a data warehouse for my previous company with FiveTran (complement by bespoke Python when FiveTran just wasn't enough), dbt, and BigQuery (along with a constellation of other GCP utilities to help orchstrate everything). 

**How did it go?**

I believe what sets me apart from my peers in the engineering space is a strong "customer sense". I can wield the tools to yield the results:

## Software Engineering

I don't have much of a public record of software engineering work, so I like to participate in the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. 

In 2022, I chose Python for the [event](https://github.com/kyleries/aoc_2022).
In [2021](https://github.com/kyleries/aoc_2021/tree/main/models) and [2020](https://github.com/kyleries/aoc_2020/tree/main/models), I chose....SQL! I wanted to challenge myself to think about the problems from more of a relational point of view and see how far I could get without resorting to a full programming language.
